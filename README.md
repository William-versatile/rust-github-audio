GitHub Audio
============

Listen to music generated by events happening across GitHub

_Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery._ - __Oscar Wilde__

But seriously, [listen-to-wikipedia](https://github.com/hatnote/listen-to-wikipedia) by [@slaporte](https://github.com/slaporte) and [@mahmoud](https://github.com/mahmoud) is the hotness.

<sub><sup><sub><sup>Use [`ULTIMATE_DREAM_KILLER`](https://github.com/debugger22/github-audio/commit/ed47067f5e56ab70d65fa31f72bf2dbc513f8f56) to filter all events except closed PRs.
